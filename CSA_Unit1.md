# Unite 1 Primitive Type RT
Notes from runeStone academy: 'Primitive Type Unite 1 Reading Section'

## First Java Notes:

In Java every open curly brace { must have a matched close curly brace }. These are used to start and end class definitions and method definitions.

You must name the file the same name as the class name with “.java” as the extension. All code (programs) in Java must be defined inside a class in a source file, and the name of the class must match the file name.

## Methods to Print Output on the Screen
Java has two different methods to print output to the screen:

> System.out.println(value) : // prints the value followed by a new line (ln)

> System.out.print(value) : // prints the value without advancing to the next line

> System.out.println("Hi there!"); // prints out the characters between the first " and the second " followed by a new line. The "Hi there!" is called a string literal, and it can have zero to many characters enclosed in starting and ending double quotes.
